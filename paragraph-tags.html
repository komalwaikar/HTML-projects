        <h2><b>What is formating tags</b></h2>
        Formatting tags can be very useful when writing HTML and are more specific than creating general CSS classes for HTML elements. <br>
        Formatting tags are primarily for modifying the way text appears.
        We can make the text bold, in italics, or even define them as a superscript or a subscript. 
        There are a whole bunch of these so we will just focus on a few of the most often used formatting tags. These tags are just like any other HTML element in that they have closing and starting tags.

       Heading tags are used by search engines to identify words which are more important than the rest of the page text. <br>
       The theory is that headings will sum up the topic of the page, so they are counted as important keywords.
